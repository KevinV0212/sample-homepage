# sample-homepage

This is an exercise from the odin project to practice advanced html and css skills
Here, I develop a hypothetical homepage for the character Kraft Lawrence from
the show _Spice and Wolf_ (Note: this site has no association with the original
IP).

## The notable skills I practiced were:

- Responsive design Across 3 device types (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- CSS effects including: transforms, transitions, and media-queries;
- Accessibility auditing:
  - Designing a keyboard and screen-reader friendly layout
  - Incorporating semantic HTML tags for assistive technologies
  - Implementing a a color scheme and design that accomodate different levels of visual ability
    - All types of color-blindness
    - Blurred vision
    - Reduced contract
